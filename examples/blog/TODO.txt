Get a random number identifier for each post

raw rand in managerment canister (look for examples)

Look at multisig vault for identifier (a simple hash might be suffcient)

use consts



DON'T FORGET
If you make a cross canister call you have to make it an update. I guess it's becuase who knows what that other canister is going to do?
